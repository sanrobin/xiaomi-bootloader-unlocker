Xiaomi limits bootloader unlock applications to a fixed daily quota (commonly reported as around 2,000). The quota resets at midnight Beijing time (UTC+8). This tool fires **30 parallel requests** at that reset moment to improve your chances of getting a slot.

Grab your token, set your delay, and walk away. The tool handles the rest.

---

## What does it do?

- Authenticates using your Xiaomi session token (extracted from browser)
- Checks if your account is eligible
- Syncs Beijing time from NTP servers (doesn't rely on your system clock)
- At the right moment, sends **30 threaded requests** simultaneously
- Saves everything to `logs/` for debugging

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mobilteknolojileri/xiaomi-bootloader-unlocker.git
cd xiaomi-bootloader-unlocker
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

It will ask for:
1. Your `new_bbs_serviceToken` (see [How to get your token](#how-to-get-your-token) below)
2. Delay in ms — press Enter for default (100ms)

You can also pass the delay directly:

```bash
python main.py --delay 100
```

### When to run

Figure out when midnight Beijing time is in your timezone, then start the script 2–5 minutes early:

| Region | Start at | Beijing midnight |
|---|---|---|
| Turkey (UTC+3) | 18:55 | 19:00 |
| Germany (UTC+1) | 16:55 | 17:00 |
| UK (UTC+0) | 15:55 | 16:00 |
| India (UTC+5:30) | 21:25 | 21:30 |
| US East (UTC-5) | 10:55 | 11:00 |

### What delay should I use?

These are rough starting points based on community experience. Check your latency first:

```bash
ping sgp-api.buy.mi.com
```

| Ping | Suggested delay |
|---|---|
| Under 100ms | `100` (optimized default) |
| 100–300ms | `300–800` |
| Over 300ms | `1000+` |

## How to get your token

Since Xiaomi now requires 2FA on all accounts (and removed the option to disable it), the tool can no longer log in with your email and password directly. Instead, you provide your session token extracted from the browser.

1. Open **Firefox** or **Chrome** on your PC
2. Install the **[Cookie Editor](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/cookie-editor)** extension ([Chrome version](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cookie-editor/hlkenndednhfkekhgcdicdfddnkalmdm))
3. Go to **https://c.mi.com** and log in to your Xiaomi account
4. Click the **Cookie Editor** extension icon in your toolbar
5. Search for **`new_bbs_serviceToken`**
6. Copy the **Value** field (a long string of characters)
7. Paste it when the tool prompts you

> ⚠️ **Keep your token private** — it grants full access to your Xiaomi account session. Never share it publicly.

## How it works

```
Token input → Status check → NTP sync → Wait → BURST (30 requests in ~450ms) → Done
```

1. Accepts your session token (extracted from browser cookies)
2. Verifies your account can actually apply
3. Pulls accurate Beijing time from 7 NTP servers
4. Waits until the configured time before midnight
5. Spawns 30 threads, each sending `POST /apply/bl-auth` (15ms apart)
6. Prints results to terminal and writes them to a log file

## After approval

Once you get approved (process may vary by device/region):

1. Wait for the cooling period (typically **72 hours**, can vary)
2. Download **Mi Unlock Tool** on PC
3. Boot your phone into fastboot (power + volume down)
4. Connect via USB and unlock through Mi Unlock Tool

## FAQ

**Does it work on mobile?**
Yes, with Pydroid 3 on Android. But PC gives better timing accuracy — use that if you can.

**Will I get banned?**
30 requests in under 0.5 seconds is aggressive but focused on a single moment in the day. To minimize risk, the script only runs the burst once. No bans have been reported for this level of activity during the global reset window, but proceed with caution.

**First attempt failed, what now?**
Try again next day. Bump the delay up a bit (try 1500ms). The quota fills fast.

**Does it work with 2FA enabled?**
Yes! The tool uses a token-based approach — you log in through your browser (which handles 2FA) and then paste the session token into the tool.
